## Decision Log

### Flavor Selection
**Options Considered**: 6 potential flavors (Sea Salt, Seaweed & Sesame, Truffle & Herb, Wasabi Kick, Garlic & Black Pepper, Miso Ginger)

**Selected for Launch**: Sea Salt, Seaweed & Sesame, Truffle & Herb

**Rationale**: These three flavors create a balanced portfolio addressing different consumer preferences. Sea Salt serves as the accessible entry point for first-time buyers and emphasizes pure mushroom flavor. Seaweed & Sesame appeals to Asian palate and amplifies umami, creating differentiation. Truffle & Herb targets premium segment and creates gourmet positioning. Together, they span mild to bold, familiar to adventurous, everyday to special occasion. Three flavors provide choice without overwhelming, and allow for clear A/B testing of consumer preferences.

### Package Size Selection
**Options Considered**: 40g, 60g, 100g, 150g, 200g, 250g

**Selected**: 100g (primary), 40g (single-serve), 200g (value pack)

**Rationale**: 100g provides optimal balance of value and consumption frequency for regular customers. At HKD 55-60, it's premium but accessible for weekly purchase. 40g single-serve at HKD 25-28 lowers barrier to trial and serves on-the-go occasions. 200g value pack rewards loyal customers with better per-gram pricing and reduces purchase frequency friction. Three sizes cover trial, regular, and loyal customer needs without excessive SKU complexity.

### Texture Specification
**Options Considered**: Hard and crunchy (like competitor products), Soft and chewy, Crispy and light (selected), Airy and puffy

**Selected**: Crispy and light texture achieved through vacuum frying

**Rationale**: Consumer feedback clearly indicated competitor products are "too hard" and "difficult to chew." Crispy and light texture addresses this primary complaint while maintaining satisfying crunch. Vacuum frying technology enables this texture while preserving nutrition and reducing oil content. The texture is differentiated enough to be noticeable improvement but familiar enough to not alienate mushroom chip enthusiasts. This specification directly addresses a market gap and creates competitive advantage.

### Nutritional Positioning
**Options Considered**: Focus on low-calorie, Focus on high-protein, Focus on vitamin D, Focus on fiber, Balanced nutritional story (selected)

**Selected**: Balanced nutritional story emphasizing multiple benefits (Vitamin D, protein, fiber, low sodium)

**Rationale**: While mushroom chips excel in Vitamin D (20% DV, rare in plant-based foods), leading with single nutrient feels reductive. Balanced story showcases comprehensive nutritional profile and appeals to broader audience. Different consumers prioritize different nutrients—some want protein, others want fiber, others want vitamins. Balanced positioning allows flexible messaging for different segments while maintaining authenticity. The "genuine nutrition" messaging in brand positioning supports this balanced approach.

### Sourcing Strategy
**Options Considered**: China suppliers (lowest cost), Taiwan suppliers (selected), Japan suppliers (highest quality), Local Hong Kong production

**Selected**: Taiwan family farm suppliers with log-grown shiitake

**Rationale**: Taiwan offers optimal balance of quality, cost, and consumer perception. Log-grown shiitake from Taiwan provides premium quality and authentic sourcing story. Consumer feedback indicated concerns about China origin, making Taiwan more appealing. Japan suppliers offer highest quality but significantly higher cost that would push retail price above HKD 70, limiting market. Local Hong Kong production requires substantial capital investment and longer timeline, inappropriate for import/distribution model. Taiwan proximity enables reasonable shipping costs and lead times while supporting compelling sustainability narrative.
