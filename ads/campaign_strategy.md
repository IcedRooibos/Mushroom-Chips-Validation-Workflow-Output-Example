- **Solution**: A/B test landing pages, add trust signals (reviews, guarantees), simplify checkout, offer first-time buyer discount

**Challenge 4: Platform Algorithm Changes**
- **Risk**: Sudden drop in reach or increase in costs
- **Solution**: Diversify across multiple platforms, build owned channels (email list), focus on organic community building

**Challenge 5: Competitor Response**
