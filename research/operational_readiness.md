## Production Process (General)

**Mushroom Chip Manufacturing Steps:**
1. Mushroom cultivation/sourcing
2. Selection and cleaning
3. Slicing (thin, uniform slices)
4. Pre-treatment (optional blanching)
5. Dehydration/frying (vacuum frying or low-heat frying preferred)
6. Seasoning application
7. Quality control
8. Packaging
9. Labelling
10. Distribution

**Key Process Considerations:**
- Vacuum frying produces crispier texture with less oil absorption
- Low-heat frying preserves nutritional value
- Dehydration alone creates harder texture (consumer complaint noted)
- Seasoning timing affects flavor distribution
- Moisture control critical for shelf life
